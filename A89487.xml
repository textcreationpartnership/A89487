            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe House were no sooner informed that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty was brought to Windsore by a Brigade of the Armies Horse, by the nominated a Committee, to consider how to proceed in a way of Justice against the King, and other capitall offendors; they gave them power to send for Papers and witnesses to examine, as to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Ireland, the poysoning of King <hi>James</hi> and other particulars, in relation to the King and Kingdome, the Committee accordingly have met, and after much scrutiny, have dr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wne up a Charge against him which is this.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Charles Steward</hi> hath acted contrary to his trust, in departing from the Parliament, setting up his Standard, making warre against them, and thereby been the occasion of much bloodshed and misery to the people, whom he was set over to protect, and defend, that he gave Commission to Rebells in Ireland to commit all manner of murthers, and outrages, and since that hath been the occasion of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond warre, for the ruine and destruction of his people, besides what he hath done contrary to the liberty of the Subject, and the destruction of the fundamentall Lawes, and Liberties of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The Councell of War have also drawne up an attainder
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116984:3"/>of high Treason against him which runs thus.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Charles Steward</hi> hath falsified his trust, trampled on the Lawes, and been the occasion of the murthering an hundred thousand English-men, with all the miseries of warre this seaven yeares, by departing from his Parliament, setting up his Standard, and making a bloudy warre in the defence of an illegall arbitrary Power, to the inslaving and vassalizing the free-borne people of England, whom he was set over for good; that he gave Commissions and was the occasion of the Rebellion in Ireland: also of the late second warre, besides what he hath done contrary to the Liberty of the Subject, and tending to the destruction of the fundamentall Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome: all which amounts to a forfeiture of his said trust.</p>
            <p>In regard whereof the Councell of Warre (who hath now the sole mannaging of the matter in reference to the King) have given Commandement, that he being no longer served after the manner of Princes upon the knee, and that all other Majestick formes be forgotten towards him; <hi>Sic transit gloria mundi, qui sibi videtur stare, videat ne cadat:</hi> the Commons house of Parliament have voted Commissioners who shall be furnished with plenary power for the triall of the King as a Traytor, and in case the King shall refuse to answer unto the Charge drawne up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, they will take care that sure and speciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be made that this shall prove no obstruction or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to the speedy bringing him to judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne punishment: The Generall Councell have almost pitcht upon a Representative, and finished it for the speedy settlement of the Kingdome, without the King and against him.</p>
            <p>That a period to this Parliament be speedily put, that so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116984:3"/>there may be a sound settlement of the peace, and future Government of the Kingdome; upon grounds of common right, freedome and safety; and therefore,</p>
            <p>That there may be a certain succession of future Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, annuall, or bienniall; with secure provision.</p>
            <p>That care be taken for the certainty of their meeting, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and rising.</p>
            <p>That there may be an equall distribution of Elections, to render the House of Commons as near as may be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Representative of the whole people electing.</p>
            <p>That according to such distributions the people may not faile of certainty to elect, and their full freedome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for and asserted.</p>
            <p>That none who have ingaged or shall ingage in warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the right of Parliament, and interest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therein, or have adhered to the enemies thereof, may be capable of electing, or being elected (at least during a competent number of yeares) nor any others, who shall oppose or not joyne in Agreement to this settlement.</p>
            <p>That it be declared (that as to the whole interest of the people of England) such Representatives have &amp; shall have the supreme Power &amp; trust, as to the making of Laws Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions and Officers for the ordering, preservation, and Government of the whole; and as to the altering, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and abolishing the same, the making of warre and peace and as to the highest and finall judgement in all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill things, without further appeale to any created stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power.</p>
            <p>That no King be hereafter admitted, but upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of, and upon trust from the people by such their Representatives, nor without first disclaiming and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing all pretence to a Negative voice against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations

            <p>His Majesty is strongly secured in the Castle of Wind▪ for by Major-Generall <hi>Whitlocke</hi> Governour thereof; when the King came into the Castle first hee appeared merry and pleasant, for being waited on to his Chamber by the Governour, and Colonell <hi>Harrison</hi> he spake smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly thus, I promised you a short way, (meaning from the place they came last) but not a faire way; for indeed it rained almost all that afternoon: The King after he had discoursed a while went himselfe to make choice of roomes to lodge and eat in, and those which he nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated were fitted according to his desire, prayes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the Scriptures to those that are about him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, since the time he was deposed: A command is come from the Generall and the Councell of Warre, that none shall be admitted to have private conference with him without speciall Warrant either from the Parliament or Generall; he is now under locks and bolts, and assures the Governour, that he will not (by any under-hand way) attempt to make an escape, except he can escape by some cleanly neat way.</p>
            <p>His Majesty is earnestly desirous, that Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> or some other of his Chaplaines may be admitted to come to him, but is not permitted, as yet, he is also very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently pressive to have leave to send to the Queen and Prince, but that also is denyed.</p>
            <p>The King since his coming to Windsor hath had some discourse with those that attend him about the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance of the Army, as to the bringing of him to a triall, asking how that could be, what way they could do it,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116984:4"/>or which way they could bring in any Charge against him; it was not said, that there is any such thing to be done by the Army, but a question was put to the King, that what if a Charge should be brought against him according to the manner of triall of the Subjects by the Lawes of the Kingdome, what would he doe? the King replyed, that if they did, he would not give any answer, and that if they did put him to death, he would die patiently like a Martyr.</p>
            <p>The House passed an Ordinance for the Election of new Common-Councell men in the roome of those that subscribed their names to the Petition for to have a Treaty with the King, and because the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Supremacy, and others are inforced upon all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be made free of the City of London, the House Ordered, That the said illegall Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, with all other of the like nature should be referred to a Committeee, to the end they may be for the future taken away.</p>
            <p>The House tooke notice, that Mr. <hi>Watson</hi> who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the last Fast-day was very darkly invective against them, not acknowledging them to bee a Parliament, they therefore ordered, that Mr. <hi>Brookes,</hi> who preached to them the same day, and was very ingenious in his acknowledgements, should have the thankes of the House, and liberty to print his Sermon, but not <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Iohn Lilburne</hi> hath put up a Paper to the Generall Councell of the Army, in a petitionary manner subscribed by divers of knowne worth, wherein he finds much fault with some particulars, of the intended modell which the Generall Councell have now almost finished, called the Agreement of the people.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:116984:5"/>
            <p> Out of Hanfordshire unto the Generall Councell of the Army, is come a woman of g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
